# Rooted

## Acknowledgment
This is my personal continuation of the roguelike game you build in the book ['Hands on Rust'](https://hands-on-rust.com/) by Herbert Wolverson that uses his [Bracket-Lib](https://github.com/amethyst/bracket-lib) library. I picked it up to learn more about Rust in a fun way, but mainly because it builds a roguelike! I really recommend the book! I'm still learning a lot from it. I also checked out the code of his most recent 7DRL project [SecBot](https://thebracket.itch.io/secbot) and of the Rust version of his Game [NoxFutura](https://github.com/thebracket/noxfutura). If you are interested in building roguelikes (or other games) in Rust, you should really check out his work, [this](https://rustgamedev.com/episodes/interview-with-herbert-wolverson-bracket-lib) is a podcast where he talks about it.

## Initial idea

### Descripion
A Roguelike (procedural generation, turn-based) which focusses on exploration and discovery of the living fable-like world of an underground ecosystem.

### Story
You are Root, a fraction of a tree's rootsystem.  Your tree is dying due to a pollution with an unknown source and therefore the tree imbued you with life in order for you to go deep underground and find a legendary pool that contains water with magical healing properties. You are to bring back a drop of it to save HomeTree, possibly find out about the source of the pollution and enjoy the ecosystem along the way.

## Current status

Before going down the road (again) of endlessly thinkering on systems of which I'm not sure why or if (and how) they should be included, and then losing motivation, I'm calling this version 1.0. It's playable, even winnable (and losable). It's got a few levels, a few creatures, a few items and a few maps. I still like the idea, so maybe I'll revisit it one day. There's an ascii version and a version that uses kenney's tiles. So: my first 'published' game :).
